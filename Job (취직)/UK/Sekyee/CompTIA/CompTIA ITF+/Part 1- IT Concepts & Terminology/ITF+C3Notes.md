# Chapter 3: Computing Basics

#it 

## Objective

- Illustrate the basics of computing and processing

## Section 1: Computer Actions

- Computers perform four basic operations: *input, processing, output & storage*
- Input
	- User provides information to the computer 
	- Computers (and IoT devices) can also provide information to other computers
- Storage
	- Storage mechanisms allow computers to maintain data with two different methods:
		- Keep some data stored in memory, where the computer accesses it on a temporary basis
		- Write data to hard drive, cloud storage service or other storage mediums where the data is held more permanently
- Processing
	- Computer analyzes data and performs operations on it 
		- Other forms of processing include manipulating image files, playing a video stored on a disk or predicting the weather
	- Most processing is done on the **Central Processing Unit (CPU)**, which will discussed in Chapter 9
- Output
	- Outputs are the computer's way of reporting to us the results of its processing
		- Though an output may be something a user may have to read and understand, it may also be fed into another computer for further processing
- Summary
	- Computers receive *input(s)* from a variety of sources (e.g. users, other devices)
	- After receiving input, computers may perform *processing* on the input and may *store* both the original and processed data on the disk
	- Computer provide *output* in the form of legible data for its end users or in the form of commands send to other devices for further processing

## Practice Questions

### Practice Question 1

- Question
	- You are assisting a manager who is trying to print a PDF report saved on their laptop for distribution to their employees at a staff meeting in a few hours. The manager is frustrated because the printer keeps jamming, preventing them from printing the report.
		- What basic computing action is causing this problem?
- Answer
	- C. Output
		- Printer is not creating the printed report, which is the output

### Practice Question 2

- Question
	- You are working with a front desk technician at a hotel and troubleshooting an issue that guests are having with the hotel's check-in kiosks. The kiosks use a touchscreen to interact with guests. The touchscreens are correctly displaying information, but when users tap buttons on the screen, the device does not respond.
		- What basic computing action is causing this problem?
- Answer
	- A. Input
		- Kiosk is not receiving user inputs (in the form of touchscreen taps)
