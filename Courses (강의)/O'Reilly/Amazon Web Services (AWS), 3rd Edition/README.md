## Overview

Amazon Web Services (AWS) LiveLessons is a full-featured video course meant to teach you AWS from the ground up. With over 18 hours of video training, this in-depth course uses foundational training, hands-on demos, and thorough analysis to first introduce you to Amazonâ€™s many AWS services and then provide in-depth examples for how to use those services. This title is a great way to start your AWS journey.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) LiveLessons starts with an overview of AWS, including AWS compute services, AWS database services, AWS Analytics services, and AWS monitoring and automation services among others and going in depth about the basics, concepts, practices, and theories of AWS to become a full-fledged AWS practitioner. The course also covers the prerequisites and skills required to be a successful candidate for AWS certification exams, including AWS Cloud Practitioner and AWS Solutions Architect exams.

This all-new video course is taught by experienced trainer Chad Smith and is full of hands-on demonstrations using both the AWS Console and the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), giving you the opportunity to test out the skills and practice your knowledge as you work your way through the course.
