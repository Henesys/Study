## Cloud Computing Foundations

### Cloud Computing Introduction

- Perils of Cloud Computing

  - Ownership of your own personal information system.

  - However...

    - Capital investment
    - Heavy fixed cost
    - Redundant expenditures
    - High energy cost/ low CPU utilization
    - Dealing with unreliable hardware
    - High levels of overcapacity

  - Ultimately, it is unsustainable to own your own information system.

- Cloud Computing

  - Cloud computing is the first step towards utility computing.

  - Cloud computing is...

    - Ubiquitious
    - Convenient
    - Easy to access (on- demand network access)
    - Rapidly provisioned

  - Cloud computing encompasses...

    - Network (data center switch + ethernet)
    - Server (ethernet + multi- processors with memory)
    - Storage (optimized for best bandwith to servers)
    - Service (e.g. stacked services)
    - Application (e.g. web services, search requests, email)

- Cloud Adoption: Gartner's Hype Cycle

  - Stages

    - Innovation Trigger (Early Forms of Cloud Computing)
    - Peak of Inflated Expectations (Big Data, ~ 2011)
    - Trough of Disillusionment (Hybrid Cloud + Cloud Computing, ~ 2014/ 5)
    - Slope of Enlightment (Virtualization)

- Delivery Models

  - Software as a Service (SaaS)

    - Use a provider's application(s) over a network.
    - e.g. Salesforce

  - Platform as a Service (PaaS)

    - Deploying customer created applications to a cloud.
    - e.g. AppEng

  - Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

    - Rent processing, storage & network.
    - Capacity and other fundamental computing resources.
    - e.g. AWS EC2, AWS S3

- Big Data Data Revolution and Clouds

  - Data collection is too large to transmit economically over the Internet.

  - Computations are data intensive.

    - Lots of disks, networks and CPUs.
    - Overhead of maintaining cyber infrastructure is expensive.
    - Users buy big data services from clouds to share the overhead.

  - Easy to write programs = Fast turnaround
    - e.g. MapReduce: Hadoop, PIG, HDFS, HBase
