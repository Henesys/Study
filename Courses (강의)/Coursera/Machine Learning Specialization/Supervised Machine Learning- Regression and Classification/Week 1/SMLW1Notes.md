## Overview of Machine Learning

### Welcome to Machine Learning

- Basically, applications of machine learning are widespread

### Applications of Machine Learning

- Basically, applications of machine learning are widespread

## Supervised vs. Unsupervised Machine Learning

### What is Machine Learning?

- What is Machine Learning?
	- "Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed" - Arthur Samuel (1959)
	- Generally speaking, the more opportunities you give for a learning algorithm to learn, the better it will perform
- Machine Learning Algorithms
	- Supervised Learning (Course 1 + Course 2)
		- Used most in real- world applications
		- Rapid advancement
	- Unsupervised Learning (Course 3)
	- Recommender Systems (Course 3)
	- Reinforcement Learning (Course 3)

### Supervised Learning (Part 1)

- Supervised Learning
	- Refers to algorithms that learn `x` to `y` or input to output mappings
	- Learning from being given "right" answers
- Regression: Housing Price Prediction
	- Regression
		- Predict a number from infinitely many possible outputs
	- Predicting housing prices based on the size of the house
	- Options
		- Line of Best Fit (Straight Line)
		- Curved Line
	- Labels
		- `x`: house size in square feet
		- `y`: price of the house in dollars

### Supervised Learning (Part 2)

- Classification: Breast Cancer Detection
	- Classification
		- Classification algorithms predict categories
		- Classification is different from regression in that we're trying to predict only a small number (finite) of possibilities (in this case two and later, three)
	- Figure out if a tumor is malignant or benign using a patient's medical records
	- Labels
		- `x`: size of the tumor in cm
		- `y`: status of the tumor (benign: `0`, malignant: `1- Type 1`, `1-Type 2`)
- Two or More Inputs
	- Using the previous example, now assume that you also have information regarding the patient's age
	- With the size of the tumor as the `x axis` and the age of the patient as the `y axis`, plot the status of the tumor & determine a *boundary line* that determines whether or not a tumor is benign or malignant
		- Can use things like KNN, decision trees, random forest, SVMs, Naive Bayes, logistic regression, neural networks from here
