### Applications of Machine Learning

## Supervised vs. Unsupervised Machine Learning

### What is Machine Learning?

- What is Machine Learning?
	- "Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed" - Arthur Samuel (1959)
	- Generally speaking, the more opportunities you give for a learning algorithm to learn, the better it will perform
- Machine Learning Algorithms
	- Supervised Learning (Course 1 + Course 2)
		- Used most in real- world applications
		- Rapid advancement
	- Unsupervised Learning (Course 3)
	- Recommender Systems (Course 3)
	- Reinforcement Learning (Course 3)

### Supervised Learning (Part 1)

- Supervised Learning
	- Refers to algorithms that learn `x` to `y` or input to output mappings
	- Learning from being given "right" answers
- Regression: Housing Price Prediction
	- Regression
		- Predict a number from infinitely many possible outputs
	- Predicting housing prices based on the size of the house
	- Options
		- Line of Best Fit (Straight Line)
		- Curved Line
	- Labels
		- `x`: house size in square feet
		- `y`: price of the house in dollars

### Supervised Learning (Part 2)

- Classification: Breast Cancer Detection
	- Classification
		- Classification algorithms predict categories
		- Classification is different from regression in that we're trying to predict only a small number (finite) of possibilities (in this case two and later, three)
	- Figure out if a tumor is malignant or benign using a patient's medical records
	- Labels
		- `x`: size of the tumor in cm
		- `y`: status of the tumor (benign: `0`, malignant: `1- Type 1`, `1-Type 2`)
- Two or More Inputs
	- Using the previous example, now assume that you also have information regarding the patient's age
	- With the size of the tumor as the `x axis` and the age of the patient as the `y axis`, plot the status of the tumor & determine a *boundary line* that determines whether or not a tumor is benign or malignant
		- Can use things like KNN, decision trees, random forest, SVMs, Naive Bayes, logistic regression, neural networks from here

### Unsupervised Learning (Part 1)

- Unsupervised Learning
	- Find something interesting (e.g. pattern, structure) in *unlabeled* data
	- We do not *supervise* the algorithm to give a "right" answer for every input
- Clustering Algorithms
	- Finds clusters (structure) that lie within the data
	- Example
		- Google News
			- Groups related stories together by going through thousands of articles
		- DNA Microarray
			- Plot each individual on the x- axis and their genes on the y- axis
			- Color the individual cell by denoting whether or not that gene is active within the individual
			- Clustering algorithms can be run on the microarray to identify potential patterns that group people together based on the status of their genes
		- Customers
			- Grouping customers based on market segments to better serve customers

### Unsupervised Learning (Part 2)

- Unsupervised Learning
	- Data only comes with inputs `x`, but not output labels `y`
	- Algorithms has to find structure or patterns in the data
	- Examples
		- Clustering
			- Group similar data points together
		- Anomaly Detection
			- Find unusual data points
		- Dimensionality Reduction
			- Compress data using fewer numbers while losing as little data as possible

## Regression Model

### Linear Regression Model (Part 1)

- Example
	- Predicting the price of the house based on the size of the house
	- Use linear regression to create a line of best fit through the Portland housing data
		- Given a house that is 1250 square feet, calculate how much the house can be sold/ bought for based on the line of best fit
		- Regression models predict *numbers* and are considered as supervised learning models because it was fed with "right" answers
			- Note that regression has infinitely many possible outputs
		- Conversely, classification models predict *categories* and are also considered supervised learning as supervised learning models for the same reasons as above
			- Note that classification has a discrete, finite set of outputs
- Terminology
	- Training Set
		- Data used to train the model
	- `x`
		- Input/ feature variable
	- `y`
		- Output/ target variable
	- `m`
		- Number of training examples
	- `(x, y)`
		- Single training example
	- $(x^{(i)}, y^{(i)})$ 
		- $i^{th}$ training example

### Linear Regression Model (Part 2)

- $f$
	- Function generated by the learning algorithm
	- Also referred to as a hypothesis
	- Takes a new input $x$ and output an estimate, $\hat{y}$
- "How to represent $f$?"
	- Assuming $f$ is linear:
		- $f_{w, b}(x) = wx + b$
			- Linear regression with *one* variable
			- Univariate linear regression
