### Introduction to OpenRefine

- A First Look at OpenRefine
	- Creating a New Project
	- Basic Normalization
	- Different Facets (Text, Timeline, Scatterplot)
	- Clustering & Mass Edits
	- Operation History: Provenance
- OpenRefine Overview
	- OpenRefine is a power tool for data wrangling, specifically:
		- For getting an overview (exploring and "profiling") of the data
		- For detecting and cleaning certain data errors
		- For transforming and linking data
	- History
		- Freebase Gridworks `-->` Google Refine `-->` OpenRefine
- Dataset Examples
	- USDA Directory of Farmers Markets
		- Smaller, more curated (?) dataset
	- New York Public Library Collection (Historic Restaurant Menus)
		- Messy, crowd- sourced data
- OpenRefine: Create Project
	- Create a Project
	- Import the Dataset (e.g. CSV)
- Text Facet 
	- X
- Undo/ Redo: Operation History (Provenance)
	- X
- Timeline Facet
	- X
	- Converting from String to Number
		- 
- Scatterplot Facet
	- 
- Example: NYPL "Menu" Collection
	- 
- Complex Data Quality Issues
	- Relying on volunteer transcription will often result in inconsistent data entry
		- Even well- transcribed data is subject to challenges due to synonyms and spelling variants
		- Entities may also change over time
- Basic Normalization
	- 
- Faceting & Clustering
