## Module Lectures

### Overview

- Phenotyping
	- Determining or predicting traits/ characteristics
	- Example
		- Multi- institutional collaboration building a reference dataset
		- Active curation during research collaboration
		- Data acquisition, storage, transformation, standardization and integration
		- Transparency and provenance of software and data products
		- Development f standard metadata vocabularies
		- Discovery, access, preservation and citation

### What is Data Science?

- Some Definitions of Data Science
	- "... work concerned with the collection, preparation, analysis, visualization, management and preservation of large collections of information" (Jeffrey Stanton, *Introduction to Data Science*, 2013)
	- "Data scientists play active roles in ... four related areas: data **architecture**, data **acquisition**, data **analysis** and data **archiving** ... Data Science is an applied activity and data scientists serve the needs and solve the problems of data users." (Jeffrey Stanton, *Introduction to Data Science*, 2013)
	- "... the science of planning for, acquisition, management, analysis of, inference and discovery from data" (Final Report from StatSNSF)
- Related Terms
	- Informatics, Data Mining, Knowledge Discovery, eScience, Cyberinfrastructure, Data Analytics, Data Curation, Big Data
- Our Definition
	- Data science is concerned with all aspects of **creation**, **management**, **analysis** and **communication** of data focusing particularly on the application of *computational methods* *to digital data*
	- The objective of data science is to extract useful knowledge from data
- Importance of Data Science Today
	- Factors that have contributed to the data science boom:
		- Vast quantities of digital data from a wide variety of sources and often arriving in real time
		- Advances in new analytical strategies and computational methods
		- Easy to use & powerful analytical tools
		- High speed global communications
		- Access to distributed high performance computing from almost anywhere in the world
		- A large community of experts in the new strategies for data management and analysis
- Data Science: The With/ Of Ambiguity
	- Existing definitions of data science reflect an ambiguity in the phrase itself
		- "Is data science to be understood as the science *of* data or as science *with* data?"
	- Wikipedia defines data science as:
		- "... the study of the generalizable extraction of knowledge from data"
		- "... the extraction of knowledge from data"
	- The literal difference is clear:
		- Doing data science is doing research on computational methods (e.g. developing new tools and techniques, studying those tools and techniques, studying their applications)
		- Doing data science is *using* data science methods to do research in *other* fields (e.g. genetics, medicines, engineering, marketing etc.)
- Our Definition Avoids the Issue
	- Data science is concerned with all aspects of the **creation, management, analysis and communication** of data focusing particularly on the application of <u>computational methods</u> to <u>digital data</u>
	- The data science objective is to *extract useful knowledge from data*
- Data Science = Data Curation + Data Analytics
	- Data science has two components:
		- Data Curation
			- Ensuring that data can be efficiently and reliably found and used
			- Primarily concerned with the ***management*** of data in order to better support the ***analysis*** of data
			- It also encompasses other things such as acquisition, collection, modeling, workflow, provenance, validity, integrity, metadata, preservation, integration, retrieval, reuse, policy, standards, identifiers, format conversions, processing levels, supporting reproducibility
		- Data Analytics
			- Employing specific techniques to extract knowledge from data

### What is Data Curation?

- Data Curation: Our Definition
	- "According to UIUC School of Information Sciences, data curation is the active and on- going management of data through its lifecycle of interest and usefulness to scholarship, science and education; curation activities enable data discovery and retrieval, maintain quality, add values and provide for re- use over time"
- "Science of" vs. "Practice of"
	- Science of Data Curation
		- Research and development on new methods of data management and use
		- Draws on mathematical and engineering methods, but also on methods from social science, law, economics and other disciplines
	- Practice of Data Curation
		- Use and adaptation of data management methods to meet user needs and support data analytics
- Data Science Values
	- Data Analytics Values
		- Extraction should be **novel, fast, precise, accurate**
	- Data Curation Values
		- Data should be efficient and reliable (**findable, usable, legal**)
		- Qualities of the data support the novelty, speed, precision and accuracy of the extraction process
- Importance of Data Curation
	- 
- Data Curation is the Larger Part of Data Science
