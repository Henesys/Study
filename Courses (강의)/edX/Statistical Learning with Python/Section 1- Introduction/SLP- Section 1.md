## Opening Remarks

- Instructors
	- Professor Trevor Hastie
	- Professor Robert Tibshirani
- Brief History
	- 1900's or before
		- Statistics existed
	- 1980's
		- People in computer science started develop the field of machine learning and neural networks
		- One of the first neural networks developed at Bell Labs was created to solve the ZIP code recognition problem
		- Seeds which eventually grew to statistical learning started to be developed alongside the field of machine learning
- Example
	- Statistics in the News
		- IBM's Watson and its appearance on *Jeopardy*
			- Watershed moment for the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence since it demonstrated to the general public the capabilities of a machine that's truly able to learn from its mistakes
		- Google
			- "I keep saying that the sexy job in the next 10 years will be statisticians. And I'm not kidding." - Hal Varian, Chief Economist at Google
		- Five Thirty Eight
			- Accurate prediction of the 2012 US Presidential and Senate races by Nate Silver
- Examples of Statistical Learning Problems
	- Identify the risk factors for prostate cancer
	- Classify a recorded phoneme based on a log periodogram
	- Predict whether someone will have a heart attack on the basis of demographic, diet and clinical requirements
	- Customize an email spam detection system
	- Identify the numbers in a handwritten ZIP code
	- Classify a tissue sample into one of several cancer classes, based on a gene expression profile
	- Establish the relationship between salary and demographic variables in population survey format
	- Classify the pixels in a LANDSAT image, by usage
- Moral of the Story
	- When you get new data for analysis, don't run it through fancy algorithms and instead opt to make some graphs & *look* at the data
